# Reza Nouri

👋 Hi, I'm Reza Nouri, an AI enthusiast and a master's student specializing in Artificial Intelligence. I have a keen interest in the fascinating realms of image processing, particularly object detection, as well as exploring the nuances of image aesthetic assessment. Additionally, I'm deeply intrigued by the world of text processing and Explainable AI, where I'm currently honing my skills in understanding how to make complex AI models more transparent and interpretable.

🌱 Currently, I'm diving into the realm of Explainability in object detection, seeking to unravel the inner workings of these models and make them more understandable to both experts and non-experts alike.

💞️ I'm actively seeking opportunities to collaborate with like-minded individuals and teams on projects related to image aesthetic assessment and object detection. If you share a passion for these areas or have an interesting project in mind, don't hesitate to reach out.

📫 You can get in touch with me through email at mr.rezanouri9696@gmail.com. I'm always excited to connect and engage in meaningful discussions or collaborations.

Feel free to explore my repositories to learn more about my projects and contributions in the field of AI and machine learning!

Happy coding and exploring the limitless possibilities of AI! 🚀
